This app is created to use Yelps Business endpoint API

It gathers input parameters to give you a random restaraunt to eat at.

There is a voting system and other features in that is in development right now. 

Yelps API is cannot be called through the front end so it needs to be hosted on a server which 
for this application is heroku.

There is a development demo for testing.
This is used to gain temporary access to heroku servers.
